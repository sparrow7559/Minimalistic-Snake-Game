#Minimalistic Snake Game
This is a minimalistic snake game made using html and javascript.
I came across this through a Youtube Video https://youtu.be/OXiyLaNo3NE?si=9H6_dj2DQJ1CoaBR, which inspired me to make this game.
This works on basic bitwise calculations, adding a new random apple everytime it is eaten and making the snake 16x16 again if it hits itself using splice.
